HasManyTenses
===================
Every model in Rails should have a created_at field. This plugin allows you to use that field to get association collections like model.collection.recent, future, past and instance booleans like mode.past? model.future? model.recent?

Prerequisites
=============
Rails 1.2.6+
Model must have created_at

Installing the plugin
=====================
  -- Get the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:peimei/has_many_tenses.git vendor/plugins/has_many_tenses
  
  -- To get access to the instance methods just add has_many_tenses to your model
     You can also modify the recency comparer via has_many_tenses(:recency => 30.minutes.ago)
      
  -- To use the association proxies do something like:
      has_many :comments, :order => 'created_at ASC', :dependent => :destroy, 
        :extend => RailsJitsu::HasManyTenses::SingletonMethods

  NOTES:
  ======
  This plugin was born from helping angelo0000 on #rubyonrails trying to dry up his code and seeing how far we could push it.
